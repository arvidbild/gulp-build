The build process must fulfill the following criteria:

-Concatenate and minify the JavaScript files
-Compile SCSS into CSS in a concatenated and minified file
-Generate JavaScript and CSS source maps
-Compress any JPEG or PNG files
-All output for the build process should be in a dist folder for distribution or deployment.
